# reTerminal-iolink
IO-Link device for reTerminal - can also be used as a RaspBerryPI-HAT

## Overview
This project enables reTerminal DM devices from Seeed Studio to be equipped with the IO-Link protocol using an STM32 microcontroller. The integration allows reTerminal DM to communicate with industrial sensors and actuators through the standardized IO-Link protocol, facilitating seamless connectivity in industrial automation systems.

## Features
- IO-Link Master Integration: Converts reTerminal DM into an IO-Link master device.
- Seamless Communication: Ensures reliable data exchange between reTerminal DM and IO-Link enabled devices.
- STM32 Microcontroller: Utilizes STM32 for efficient processing and communication.
- SPI Full Duplex Communication: Establishes a reliable SPI connection between the STM32 and reTerminal DM in full duplex mode.
- Flexible Configuration: Easily adaptable for various industrial applications.

## Software Requirements

## Installation
1. Set Up Development Environment
Install STM32CubeIDE.
Import the project into STM32CubeIDE.
Compile the project and upload the firmware to the STM32 microcontroller.
2. Hardware Connections
Connect the STM32 microcontroller to the reTerminal DM via SPI in full duplex mode.
Ensure proper connections between the SPI pins (MOSI, MISO, SCK, and CS) on both devices.
Connect the IO-Link transceiver to the STM32 as per the circuit diagram provided in the /docs folder.
3. Configure SPI Communication
Initialize SPI on the STM32 in full duplex mode to facilitate communication with reTerminal DM.
Ensure that the SPI clock speed and other settings are configured according to the specifications of both the STM32 and reTerminal DM.
4. Configure IO-Link Master
Use the provided configuration files to set up the IO-Link master parameters.
Ensure that the IO-Link master is correctly configured to communicate with your specific IO-Link devices.
